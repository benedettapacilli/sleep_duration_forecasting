# ðŸ’¤ Sleep Duration Forecasting with Operational Analytics

This project analyzes and forecasts **daily sleep duration** using data collected from a Mi Band device, applying three different predictive modeling techniques:
- **ARIMA** â€” a classical statistical approach for univariate time series,
- **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)** â€” a feedforward neural network built with PyTorch,
- **Random Forest Regressor** â€” a machine learning model using lagged features and recursive prediction.

All models were trained and evaluated on the same 80/20 train-test split.  
Performance was measured using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE metrics.

| Model         | MAE    | RMSE   | MAPE   |
|---------------|--------|--------|--------|
| ARIMA         | ~82.8  | ~105.6 | ~9.4%  |
| MLP           | ~89.4  | ~120.2 | ~10.1% |
| Random Forest | ~108.5 | ~135.5 | ~12.8% |

Statistical testing (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) revealed statistically significant differences between the models. Residuals from all models passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test.

## ðŸš« Privacy & Data Notice

This repository **does not include any personal or real health data**.  
- The original Mi Band data and model predictions have been excluded for privacy.
- A **synthetic example CSV** is provided in `src/data/` to demonstrate the expected input structure.

## ðŸ“ˆ How to Run

1. Place your own cleaned sleep time series data in:
   ```
   src/data/cleaned_sleep_timeseries.csv
   ```
   Format:
   ```csv
   index,sleep_duration
   2024-01-01,435
   2024-01-02,420
   ...
   ```

2. Run the desired scripts, for instance:
   ```bash
   python src/arima_forecast.py
   ```

Each script produces plots and prints performance metrics.
