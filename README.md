# ðŸ’¤ Sleep Duration Forecasting with Operational Analytics

This project analyzes and forecasts **daily sleep duration** using data collected from a Mi Band device, applying three different predictive modeling techniques:
- **ARIMA**,
- **MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)**,
- **Random Forest Regressor**.

## ðŸš« Privacy & Data Notice

This repository **does not include any personal or real health data**.  
- The original Mi Band data and model predictions have been excluded for privacy.
- A **synthetic example CSV** is provided in `src/data/` to demonstrate expected input structure.

## ðŸ“ˆ How to Run

1. Place your own cleaned sleep time series data in:
   ```
   src/data/cleaned_sleep_timeseries.csv
   ```
   Format:
   ```csv
   index,sleep_duration
   2024-01-01,435
   2024-01-02,420
   ...
   ```

2. Run the desired scripts, for instance:
   ```bash
   python src/arima_forecast.py
   ```

Each script produces plots and prints performance metrics.
